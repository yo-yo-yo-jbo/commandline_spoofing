# Commandline spoofing on Windows
So, in this blogpost I wanted to cover a well-known technique with a limitation that is not well-documented.  
I hope to share some slight insights on Windows process creation and internals.  
The topic of today is spoofing process commandlines on Windows.

## Motivation
